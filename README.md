# eso-have-want-bot

This is a bot that handles character progression and want-lists.
It was written for use in Elder Scrolls Online communities, but could
easily be used for other games and communities as well.

The storage will follow a user across communities as well, making it easier to
maintain your want-lists from wherever you are

See [this website](https://www.evogames.org/bots/eso-have-want-bot/) for some documentation
on using the bot.

## TODO

- upgrade to use discord-bot-lib v2
- consider making server-specific
